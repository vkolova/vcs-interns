## LINTERS & THE BROKEN WINDOW THEORY.

> Linting is the automated checking of your source code for programmatic and stylistic errors. This is done by using a lint tool (otherwise known as linter). A lint tool is a basic static code analyzer.

> Broken window theory is the concept that each problem that goes unattended in a given environment affects people's attitude toward that environment and leads to more problems.

### Advantages
- **Fewer errors in production.** The use of linters helps to diagnose and fix technical issuesâ€”e.g. code smellsâ€”in the code. As a result, fewer defects make their way to production.
- **Readable, maintainable, and more consistent code.** -  Linters can help teams achieve a more readable and consistent style, through the enforcement of its rules.
- **Fewer discussions about code style and aesthetic choices during code reviews.** Code review discussions shouldnâ€™t be riddled with endless arguments about stylistic preferences. Linters can take those topics out of the way.
- **Objective measurement of code quality.** Discussions about code quality often veer into subjectivity. Linters provide an objective and measurable assessment of code quality.
- **More secure and performant code.** Not all linters analyze source code regarding its performance and safety, but some do.
- **Education about code quality reaches more developers.** Linters can help developersâ€”particularly the most inexperienced onesâ€”to learn about code quality.
