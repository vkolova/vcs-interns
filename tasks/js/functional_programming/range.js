// Texas Ranger!

// Implement a function, called `range` with the following signature
// The function returns a list of integers, staring with `from` and finishing with `to` inclusive.
// For example `range(1,10)` would give us the `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]` list.
// Try to implement the function, using recursion and `[].concat`!

function range (from, to) {

};

console.assert(range(1, 10) === [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]);
